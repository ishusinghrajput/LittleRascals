        <h3 class="firstpara">The Little Rascals is a 1994 American family comedy film produced by Amblin Entertainment,
             and released by Universal Pictures on August 5, 1994. The film is an adaptation of Hal Roach's Our Gang, a series of short films of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s (many of which were broadcast on television as The Little Rascals) which
             centered on the adventures of a group of neighborhood children.
             The film, with a screenplay by Paul Guay, Stephen Mazur,
             and Penelope Spheeris – who also directed – presents several 
            of the Our Gang characters in an updated setting, and features re-interpretations of several of the original shorts. It is the first collaboration by Guay and Mazur, whose subsequent comedies were Liar Liar and Heartbreakers.

        <h3 class="secondpara"> Spanky McFarland is the president of the "He-Man Womun Haters Club" with many school-aged boys from around the neighborhood as members. Alfalfa Switzer, Spanky's best friend, has been chosen to be the driver for the club's prize-winning go-kart, "The Blur", in the upcoming Soap Box Derby go-kart race. However, Alfalfa is nowhere to be found. The boys go to find Alfalfa and discover him in the company of his sweetheart Darla, with whom he is forbidden to be in love because she is a girl, which goes against club rules. Alfalfa invites Darla on a picnic, and to prove his devotion to her, he agrees to have the picnic inside the clubhouse. Unbeknownst to Alfalfa, his fellow club members find out about his plans.

At the picnic, Alfalfa and Darla think they are alone, but the other club members secretly pull several silly pranks to sabotage their romantic date. When they finally reveal themselves and demand to come inside the clubhouse, Alfalfa frantically tries to convince Darla to hide in the closet, which leads her to mistakenly believe that Alfalfa feels ashamed of her. In the frenzy, a candle flame gets out of control, ultimately causing the clubhouse to burn down. Darla breaks up with Alfalfa and turns her attentions towards Waldo, the wealthy new kid in town whose father is an oil tycoon. Because Alfalfa burned down the clubhouse and also fraternized with a girl, he is assigned by Stymie to guard the go-kart until the day of the race and refrain from even thinking about Darla.

Alfalfa makes several attempts to win back Darla, including sending her a fake love note. When that fails, Spanky goes with him to formally break things off with Darla. They are initially denied entrance to her ballet recital, but Spanky insists that they will wait for Darla to come out; Spanky gives Alfalfa a frog to play with while they wait. They are soon spotted by the neighborhood bullies, Butch and Woim, who chase them inside the building. To escape, Spanky and Alfalfa duck into a costume room and disguise themselves as ballerinas in pink tights, tutus, and wigs. They manage to evade the bullies, but they attempt to enter another room to get out of their disguises. They are surprised to find the room filled with girls, including Darla.

The boys nervously pretend to be in the recital that is about to take place. but Alfalfa almost gives them away when the frog he is still holding croaks. Darla admits that she doesn't miss him, but does miss his voice. Just as they are about to back out of the room, the ballet mistress enters and ushers them all on stage. The recital begins, as the children are performing scenes from "The Nutcracker." Alfalfa hands the frog to Spanky, but Spanky drops the frog into the waistband of Alfalfa's tights. Alfalfa squirms in discomfort as the frog wriggles around in his tights, turning the show to chaos as he tries to catch it while still dancing along. The girls break out into laughter, along with the audience. The recital ends, and the boys run off stage.

The ballet mistress, furious that the boys ruined her recital, confronts them and throws them out immediately, Alfalfa in his underwear and Spanky still in drag. Butch and Woim are waiting for them outside the door, so Spanky distracts them while Alfalfa sneaks out. When Spanky loses his wig, the bullies give chase. Spanky manages to lose them, but they bump into Alfalfa, who is trying to run home in his underwear. Butch and Woim chase Alfalfa into a mansion, but are turned away by the maid. Escaping through the back door, Alfalfa is chased by Waldo's family Doberman, Fifi, and he leaps into a pool and swims to the other side. As he climbs out, he pauses to notice himself naked--his underwear slipped off now floating on the surface of the pool. As Alfalfa retrieves it, he discovers Darla and Waldo in a hot tub, laughing at him, to his embarrassment. At the carnival talent show the day before the race, the boys try to fund-raise $450, the cost of the lumber needed to rebuild their clubhouse. The youngest club members, Buckwheat and Porky, have unwittingly come up with $500, not exactly in honest ways.

Their school teacher, Miss Crabtree, finds out about the scheme and confronts Spanky, but he convinces her to donate the money to be given as first prize in the go-kart derby. Alfalfa, trying to get Darla off his mind, finds the prank list and realizes that Spanky and the other boys sabotaged his picnic with Darla. He drives "The Blur" to the talent show to confront him, but when he sees Darla singing on stage with Waldo, he once again tries to win her back, this time through song, being that Darla mentioned after she dumped him that the only thing she ever really missed about him was his singing voice. However, Waldo sabotages his attempts to serenade her by putting soap in his drinking water, causing him to burp out bubbles all throughout his song. As a result of Alfalfa's carelessness, "The Blur" is eventually stolen by Butch and Woim. Alfalfa and Spanky have a falling out, but at Stymie's urging, they reconcile and band together with the other boys to build "Blur 2: The Sequel". Alfalfa and Spanky decide to ride in the two-seat go-kart together. They hope to win the prize money, which is to be presented to the winners by A.J. Ferguson, Spanky's favorite driver.

Butch and Woim make several sneaky attempts to stop Alfalfa and Spanky from winning the race. Waldo and Darla are also in the race, but they are eventually annoyed with each other, up to the point where Darla discovers Waldo’s sabotage at the talent show, and Waldo seemingly kicks Darla out from his car. In a wild dash to the finish, Butch and Woim attempt to ram “The Blur 2” off the road until a masked Waldo saves them. Despite the many scrapes and crashes throughout the race, "The Blur 2" crosses the finish line ahead of the pack in a photo-finish between "The Blur" and "The Blur 2" literally by a hair, due to Alfalfa's pointy hairstyle. After the race, Butch and Woim, angry about losing, they attempt to beat up Alfalfa, but he finally stands up for himself and punches Butch in the face, knocking him into a pool of pig slop. Woim, scared, jumps into the slop willingly. Along with first prize, Alfalfa also wins back Darla, after it is revealed that it had been Darla who had kicked Waldo out of their car and finished the race alone, pretending to be him. Meanwhile, Spanky is shocked at the trophy presentation when he finally meets A.J. Ferguson, who turns out to be a woman. Spanky confesses to Darla that he and the boys were responsible for ruining their picnic lunch, and Darla forgives him for this.

After the club house is rebuilt, the boys collectively have a change of heart towards membership and they decide to welcome Darla and her friends as well as other girls into the club.
