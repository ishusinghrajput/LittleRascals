        <h3 class="firstpara">The Little Rascals is a 1994 American family comedy film produced by Amblin Entertainment,
             and released by Universal Pictures on August 5, 1994. The film is an adaptation of Hal Roach's Our Gang, a series of short films of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s (many of which were broadcast on television as The Little Rascals) which
             centered on the adventures of a group of neighborhood children.
             The film, with a screenplay by Paul Guay, Stephen Mazur,
             and Penelope Spheeris – who also directed – presents several 
            of the Our Gang characters in an updated setting, and features re-interpretations of several of the original shorts.
             It is the first collaboration by Guay and Mazur, whose subsequent comedies were Liar Liar and Heartbreakers. 
             At the picnic, Alfalfa and Darla think they are alone, but the other club members secretly pull several silly pranks to sabotage their romantic date. When they finally reveal themselves and demand to come inside the clubhouse, Alfalfa frantically tries to convince Darla to hide in the closet, which leads her to mistakenly believe that
              Alfalfa feels ashamed of her. In the frenzy, a candle flame gets out of control, ultimately causing
               the clubhouse to burn down. Darla breaks up with Alfalfa and turns her attentions towards Waldo, the wealthy new kid in town whose father is an oil tycoon.

        <h3 class="secondpara"> Spanky McFarland is the president of the "He-Man Womun Haters Club" with many school-aged boys from around the neighborhood as members. Alfalfa Switzer, Spanky's best friend, has been chosen to be the driver for the club's prize-winning go-kart, "The Blur", in the upcoming Soap Box Derby go-kart race. However, Alfalfa is nowhere to be found.
             The boys go to find Alfalfa and discover him in the company of his sweetheart Darla, with whom he is forbidden to be in love because she is a girl, which goes against club rules. Alfalfa invites Darla on a picnic, and to prove his devotion to her, he agrees to have the picnic inside the clubhouse. Unbeknownst to Alfalfa, his fellow club members find out about his plans.

            When that fails, Spanky goes with him to formally break things off with Darla. They are initially denied entrance to her ballet recital, but Spanky insists that they will wait for Darla to come out; Spanky gives Alfalfa a frog to play with while they wait. They are soon spotted by the neighborhood bullies,
             Butch and Woim, who chase them inside the building. To escape, Spanky and Alfalfa duck into a costume room and disguise themselves as ballerinas in pink tights, tutus, and wigs. They manage to evade the bullies,
              but they attempt to enter another room to get out of their disguises. They are surprised to find the room filled with girls, including Darla.

The boys nervously pretend to be in the recital that is about to take place. but Alfalfa almost gives them away when the frog he is still holding croaks. Darla admits that she doesn't miss him, but does miss his voice.
 Just as they are about to back out of the room, the ballet mistress enters and ushers them all on stage. The recital begins, as the children are performing scenes from "The Nutcracker." Alfalfa hands the frog to Spanky, but Spanky drops the frog into the waistband of Alfalfa's tights. Alfalfa squirms in discomfort as the frog wriggles around in his tights, turning the show to chaos as he tries to catch it while still dancing along.
  The girls break out into laughter, along with the audience. The recital ends, and the boys run off stage.
